                <p><strong>HTML</strong> <br> HyperText Markup Language, allows web users to create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes. However,        
                it&apos;s worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can&apos;t create dynamic functionality.</p>
                
                <p><strong>CSS</strong> <br> Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML 
                (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p> 
               
                <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> <br> is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 
                All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
